### A brief overview of "Office"

- The term "Office" refers to a family of software which allows people to create documents, spreadsheets and presentations. The term was introduced by Bill Gates on August 1, 1988, at COMDEX in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for an office suite (bundled set of productivity applications), the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, OLE data integration, and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language. 

- Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand. On July 10, 2012, Softpedia reported that Office was being used by over a billion people worldwide.

- Office (Microsoft) has been very successful to become the standard for people, students, and businesses to create and collaborate on documents. Over the years the office product suite moved from a local install to an online version (Office 365) and a number of other products have come to market to challenge that leading position (the Google Docs suite being the largest competitor).

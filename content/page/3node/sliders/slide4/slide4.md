In 2016, the United Nations officially declared Internet access to be a human right. The right to internet access aims to protect peopleâ€™s freedom of expression and opinion, as well as other fundamentals such as access to knowledge and information.

Yet as of today, about 48% of humanity remains unconnected to the Internet, creating huge inequalities in the access to information and knowledge. It is important that the right steps are taken to improve the relationship between governments and citizens and to uphold all human rights.

To make the new internet accessible and equal to all, ThreeFold built an infrastructure that is affordable to all and collectively owned by the network peers. To ensure a fair and equal distribution of the internet to everyone, fully sponsored capacity will be deployed in remote regions of our world.

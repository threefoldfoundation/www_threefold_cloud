It is the official medium of exchange for capacity on the ThreeFold Grid.

<br />
Farmers, the equivalent of miners on the Threefold Grid, get rewarded in TFT according to the amount of capacity (CPU, RAM, SDD/HDD) they connect to the network every month, we call this proof-of-capacity. 
<br />
<br />
Users, developers, and enterprises use TFT to reserve the capacity they need to create, use and share their workloads and applications on the network.
<br />
<br />
TFT will become even more important with staking. When you stake your TFT you'll be able to help secure TFT and earn rewards. In this system, the peer-to-peer community finds an interest to hold the token to stimulate a healthy economy.

The professorships gives him the responsibility to talk to the next active generation and to transfer the desire to learn and to make the best use out of what we have. Culture in all forms is for Paolo, actually working in materials for clean energy, a renewable and precious source of power. His main aim is to contribute to reunify art, science, and relationships, because these define our 'being human in a natural world'. Gathering people in special events to communicate and inspire has been something Paolo learned in numerous past experiences. Ambassador fell in love with Threefold To change is possible, it is always a possible way in front of us, but to change is an opportunity to wisely use. When a change is felt positive, it is because of a new balance between us and the place and time in which we live has increased and this change can be called improvement. Transforming the economy seems impossible, but we made it the way it is today and we are the only element in the universe able to improve it by making it more natural. The ThreeFold Token project is for me a clear step forward in this direction heading to a more balanced future to be profited by all of us.","excerpt":"Paolo has constantly been forming and training himself in both natural and human sciences.","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/paolo-piccardo-87a87a6/","websites":"https://threefold.io/","countries":["Italy"],"cities":[],"private":1,"image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/paolo_piccardo_processed.a68c322.7cb4797b15c397a98265aaac42c83a82.jpg","size":{"width":150,"height":150},"sizes":"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px","srcset":["/assets/static/paolo_piccardo_processed.a68c322.7cb4797b15c397a98265aaac42c83a82.jpg 150w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 150 150' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-03a806f3d3e8aa4c8aac77578aa373fd'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-03a806f3d3e8aa4c8aac77578aa373fd)' width='150' height='150' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCABAAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUEBgcIAwL/xAAyEAACAQIEBAQEBQUAAAAAAAABAgMEEQAFEiEGMUFRBxMiYRRxgaEjQlKRsQgVMsHh/8QAGQEAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwQAAgUB/8QAHxEAAgICAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAECAxEhBBIxMkFR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDqnAcA5YDyxCHIXjHGnE/i5nUVNWPCKQJAx6kqqhlHYXJ%2b/fC2k8O3rQvkV8IjGzK6kG3z/fH1x1MmW%2bKPE9TURMhkzJlVY7k7gG9vfFm4K4iyqeRokEy1AF9Mq2Pvb2xkcm21Sbh4PVQh136Jc34DEMSs2ZN5gA8pYwAiH2Ha/wBcLvD3OZ/D7xKy%2bX4pJKapK0lSW28yJmG57FSQb%2b2LNxbxVlNPWPAIZ5qkGzaALAnuTjPaxUzatoqunRkm%2bKWErIATp5m4Ox5Y5xrrU8z%2bTtlcWsR9O7hgxGyxpHy2ladtUpiQu1rXbSLm3TfEnGwhAMGDBiEOa/G3h6GHxHknqAr02bU6SFBsQ6eg/wAKcVmkyqPLuIMqWnKmYyXXSoXnzJt3xqP9R0dLFHw9XPUxR1Uc7wiIt63RgCWA7AqL/PGO1U1UM5ikDMkkT6lmRgb/AH5Wxj8qLVrSemaFEk4LWxzT5bDmOY1iTyJ5rSmRkdQdRFxcA9uWPPhbIIs48RMiyiG0FNFMZXAF/RGNRG3fl9cQadasVk0ivcM3mPM7i4Y9Rbl12xafB/MMopPElqrNa6KncxNT0fmA2llcgWvyHpHXvgdEW7Em9F7ZJQetnTY2AwYMGNwzCJmeZUeV05nzCpip4uWqRrXPYdziozeIVHVM1Nk9PUT1bHSjvHaIe5N/sMUpRVZ9Xf3HOXEtSdlQX0RD9KDp/JwyOXQTUzQSIdGoMQpI374TnyHnEQih/TL/AB%2boauoloK6pmkkqPiD6rmwGm%2bw6D2xT8ozGSjVviYPOjYjfTqtjYeMMjq67JEpoozN8K/mx39RZSCCvz3xm9Pl7xOxiUrGTYqen0/1hG2z8kN0xWNC3Nc5mroFo8up2jUm5OmwGEC5ZNJmcUmt/wirEg9Qb3xoEdE8ikAoNugx75Vw3UVdR8LSBWlf1EtsFHVmPYYFG3rqISUE/o1zJeIs0yECmqFkzGl8rzEV3/FXfdQx527H98Wfh/jnKs3kWnkZqKsY2WCo9Jb5HkT7YpFNHI8slXJI%2bvQABf02G1wOnXETM6CKqifzUWzb7jD8L5R0xJwTPShYqsTXt%2bRvdl/5hurhXBFtN7c%2b%2bEm6VTxKpIkCVCD22BH8YdRQSMlig22PqH0wJliVExQ3I1AE3B6g8xhDxlkAqIZczoIlug1SqvN1/UR3H3Hyw/igl1AkAdP8AIYl04lg9RClDsy36YrKPZYZ2MuryjFoG1ShI11SE6VVeZPQfXGm5FkUWU0b/ABB8ytlCmVr7Aj8o9gdv3OIuW8JJR8ZVGYDSKBAJYU6rIb3HyA3HzHbFhnimlvpAVTvubHFIVddsvZZ20hbOdSScrMwUW7YgVkgCuByAw0mo5CAAyAC554WV1G4hdi6HS4Deq22x274IkDyf/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"belongsTo":{"totalCount":0,"pageInfo":{"totalPages":1,"currentPage":1},"edges":[]}},"memberships":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"tech","title":"tech","path":"/team/memberships/tech/"}},{"node":{"id":"foundation","title":"foundation","path":"/team/memberships/foundation/"}}]}},"context":{}}

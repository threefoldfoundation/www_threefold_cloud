# Presearch

![](./img/presearch1.png)

## Joint Mission

Empowering the Presearch community with solutions that help them further and truly decentralize their Internet search experience. 

## About Presearch 

Presearch is an open, decentralized search engine that rewards community members with Presearch Tokens for their usage, contribution to, and promotion of the platform. In a world where one company controls 77% of all searches, influencing trillions of dollars in spending, shaping perceptions and effectively acting as the primary gatekeeper to the Internet, a new, open and community-driven search engine is a necessity. Presearch has an innovative go-to-market strategy to target the most frequent searchers - web workers - and gain early adoption, on our way to releasing future versions of the open source platform that will utilize a blockchain-based index, curated by the community.

## Presearch and ThreeFold

Presearch (and its node and storage infrastructure) will benefit from ThreeFold’s peer-to-peer cloud in two different ways:
<br/>
<br/>

- First, the Presearch community will be able to deploy their Presearch nodes in a few clicks in a completely decentralized cloud infrastructure, using the ThreeFold peer-to-peer cloud and its developer tools. Thus, they can escape the monopolies of centralized cloud providers, and reduce the technical complexity of running Blockchain nodes.
- Second, Presearch and ThreeFold are exploring the usage of ThreeFold’s decentralized storage capacity to store and archive Presearch’s indexes and other data running the search engine. The main goal is to provide an unbreakable data storage and backup infrastructure for the future of the search engine experience that the top-notch team behind Presearch is building.
- Additionally, ThreeFold will be establishing Presearch’s decentralized search engine as its main search engine partner, advocating for its usage within its growing community of developers, cloud capacity farmers, enterprises, and users.

A public peer-to-peer overlay network to connect everything on the planet. Connections are end-to-end encrypted and take the shortest path. Think of it as a Local Area Network (LAN) on a planetary scale, a "global peer-to-peer VPN" that lives on top of other networks and looks for any path to connectivity. Strongly authenticated at the edge.

## About TomoChain

<br/>
<br/>

- Fast & Near-Zero Fees: 2000 TPS, 2-second block time, ~$0 gas fees, and EVM compatible
- An array of original features and protocols is designed to support speed, privacy, usability, and liquidity needs all in one platform

## TomoChain and ThreeFold

TomoChain and ThreeFold joined forces to solve a major problem for web3 developers and node operators looking into building decentralized applications on top of The TomoChain Blockchain, which is IT automation and decentralization.
<br/>
<br/>

- ThreeFold provides TomoChain's community of Masternode owners, dapp developers, and TomoDEX developers with an autonomous workload execution through its native Smart Contracts for IT and Blockchain Database, while simplifying the process of running a TomoChain Masternode process through its efficient containerization and deployment mechanism. 
- TomoChain provides a broad array of developers tools and a whole suite of Blockchain products
- And by leveraging the decentralization, docker/kubernetes compatibility, and privacy aspects of ThreeFold's P2P compute/storage/networking capacities, developers have the ability to build robust and scalable containerized dApps on top of TomoChain and deploy them close to where their users are located. 

## Get Started

You will be able to soon deploy a TomoChain Masternode via the **ThreeFold Marketplace**'s dashboard in a few clicks. Stay tuned!

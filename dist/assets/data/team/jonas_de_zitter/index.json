I became an electronics engineer in 2008 and developing firmware, electronic circuits and printed circuit boards ever since. In 2017, I founded cryptoconnect together with Gert De Spiegeleer to explore crypto mining, develop hardware and start hosting the threefold nodes. Since then, I became more and more interested in the threefold project, and started exploring farming possibilities with recovered hardware and joined Gert in the Da Vinci chapter. Ambassador fell in love with Threefold Since the first time I got in touch with threefold, I was fascinated by the idea of building a new decentralized internet with a much lower power consumption. I bought the blockchain node and threefold tokens in 2017, and since then, the project became bigger and bigger to eventually become a complete decentralized solution. The whole idea that big companies own our data and keep track of our behaviour is something that really need to change. People don't realize the consequences of a centralized internet dominated by big companies, and they need to become aware of that. I believe that the threefold project is the first complete ecosystem that can achieve true decentralization in a very efficient way. As a crypto entrepreneur, I'm really convinced that digital coins and tokens have a bright future as an alternative to fiat money, but I realised that the first generation blockchain projects are very power hungry and are not sustainable at all. The TFT and the creation of the gold, coffee and other sustainable tokens cought my attention, en I would be happy to promote them to my customers, friends and family. Once the grid is live and applications are developed, the promotion of and the transition to the threefold grid can start.","excerpt":"Fascinated by technology and electronics since I was a teenager.","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonas-delrue/","websites":"","countries":["Belgium"],"cities":[],"private":1,"image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/jonas_de_zitter.a68c322.ff02591aa4410f5e18765d94ebe48598.jpg","size":{"width":150,"height":150},"sizes":"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px","srcset":["/assets/static/jonas_de_zitter.a68c322.ff02591aa4410f5e18765d94ebe48598.jpg 150w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 150 150' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-0abe197ac3d37df4e79b641bf7ec4df5'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-0abe197ac3d37df4e79b641bf7ec4df5)' width='150' height='150' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCABAAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAHAAAAgMAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcFBggBAwQC/8QAMxAAAQMDAgMGAwgDAAAAAAAAAQIDBAAFEQYSITFBBxMiUWFxFFKRCCMyobHB0eEVQ4H/xAAZAQEBAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBQIBAAP/xAAgEQACAQQCAwEAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADBBEhEjEFIlFB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDVNQmrtVWXSFpVcdRXBmFFB2gryVLV8qUjio%2bgFSVznRrXbpU6c6lmLGbU864rklCRkn6CsParvUrtR1vKvNxLiLc1lENhX%2bpnJ2gDluPMn%2bq%2bdSoKYyZtELtxEalx%2b1NGXclM2HS8iXGHJyRJDS1Dz2hKsfWr1oDtzsOp5sa33CM9Z7hIIQ2l9QW0tfyhYxx9wKQ9stkGKtPdsJz7ZqzMx4jzXcuxkqQrpt5/360Jrwg6Eor4xiNmauoqk9l98XPtX%2bPmOFcqGkBKlDBca5JJ8yORPXn1q7U6nUFRQwk50KMVbsQooorcxFx9odxxvsf1CGiQXENtqOeSVOpB/Ksw6UZb%2bCw2naAMHj1xWpu3UtL7MrvFdJDksIYZwM/eFYKc%2bnh41mPTkddvilh5I73JUcHI4%2btCuiOo2yptz5fknYCGGXW/iJseOXDhAWncpfoBVis94trjEpxhbboZCtq0jgrbzxVYYiJkbkxmkqkqOd/NWcdK4sMZLL7DKSmMQst7FDxFWePD%2baEcHqWFDjbdRpdk92YmaoYWhUtCjvaUXU%2bFeU58JHDGcU8qQlqcVBlsGEoKaaWHMpTtyUnjT5aWHG0rTyUAR/2m2TZBWSvIUyrBvs%2bqKKKbJ8r2vdPJ1PpeXbs7XyA4wv5XUnKT7Z4H0JrKAjyoct2POQ43LaUUuocSQoHJ51tCkH2/28NaogTUnHxEXYfdtR/ZYotzTBHONtK5X0lT0wkfFZaA7wIJRn5scPzqBtUWW/PMiQ0Q4nJWtxzGOeThP817bTJXGc7xON%2bDjjXc3FXIKXHVuBkq8aeINBIOZVFdT3LbaYTzLrT6VtCOUElKN3i4cOZp/W1Kk26KlfBQaQD74FJjs/tIuM%2bMzgoYGXXEKyMoSegPmcD607xSrNCMsZNv6ocgCFFFFOk%2bFIvtLuNu1VfNsJ7vmYSSwHkdHNx3YzzHIeRxUJdO0jUV3S8zLe%2bChuApU3FbCTg9CpXHl5YqK0592p1C8bXDuQscArgBy6HAFcGH0ZksRtZ0Itq4z%2b19IU2TkOJH6%2bVWe2xwChKiVDpRtABJ/CkZJNe%2bz948XUqY7nuwCNywd3tj9KLVtm7TqPt7tTqro/ZVdc3aRZ9R2FqEtyOtSHnQ4g4IUCkD96bOie0JM62pF3QsvowkutJyFepHQ%2b1J/XikyNVtsvN7lNRMNj1UeBH0q82SAYluaQfxkBSj1JwK9bqwE5eFdYjmhy2JrCXorqXGzyUn9K76oejppiXAR1H7p/hjyV0/j6VfKUIIHM//2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"belongsTo":{"totalCount":0,"pageInfo":{"totalPages":1,"currentPage":1},"edges":[]}},"memberships":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"foundation","title":"foundation","path":"/team/memberships/foundation/"}},{"node":{"id":"tech","title":"tech","path":"/team/memberships/tech/"}}]}},"context":{}}

The mother of the home and small office nodes. With dimensions no bigger than a regular desktop PC it really packs a punch with a very powerful processor and loads of storage. It is highly recommended putting this behind a stable (preferably fiber) internet connection. There is no technical experience required to install a Venus Node as it comes "plug and farm". All that needs to be done is: connect it to the modem with a network cable and a power source.

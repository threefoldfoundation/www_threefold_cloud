In my last role, partner sales executive, I managed the top Belgian partners for Microsoft’s Cloud Productivity business, leveraging my broad experience as a highly successful solution specialist for Office 365.As a solution specialist I accomplished (1x) +100% and (3x) +150% quota attainment, for which I was rewarded in 2012 with the Microsoft Circle of Excellence Top Attainment Platinum Award.Prior to the solution sales role I was for 5 years a product marketing manager for SharePoint and Office Professional Plus. Main achievement in this role is my leading contribution in developing the SharePoint ecosystem, particularly by devotedly representing Microsoft at virtually all public platforms where collaboration, enterprise content management and enterprise search were debated, directly and indirectly supporting the local SharePoint – and by consequence the Office – revenue growth acceleration. I started at Microsoft in January 1999 as a systems engineer and later developer evangelist, typically spending most of my time preparing and delivering TechNet & MSDN roadshows, covering a wide spectrum of products including Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, BizTalk Server and all Microsoft programming languages and development tools.In between I was for approximately 4 years a partner technology advisor, supporting the recruitment and development of Microsoft business partners, especially in new business opportunity domains. In this period I gradually converted from being rather technology-oriented to more business-focused, without losing my passion for technology. Before joining Microsoft I worked at Softamed, a computer telephony integration (CTI) start-up. In 1999 I co-founded Artilium, a mobile virtual network enabler (MVNE) spin-off. The internet should treated as a human right for all, and I love contributing to a goal that would make this possible.","excerpt":"Future-proof Competence Developer | Matchmaker | Inspirator | Passionate about People & Technology","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yveskerwyn/","websites":"","countries":["Belgium"],"cities":["Ghent"],"private":1,"image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/yves_kerwyn.a68c322.ee328c33d281659c0edac5c61a696389.jpg","size":{"width":150,"height":150},"sizes":"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px","srcset":["/assets/static/yves_kerwyn.a68c322.ee328c33d281659c0edac5c61a696389.jpg 150w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 150 150' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-ec2f1e2bda1addc0a9ad66f35c6f0f39'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-ec2f1e2bda1addc0a9ad66f35c6f0f39)' width='150' height='150' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2b%2bIzTlvuyYkGNJnNqIR19m2wT3OSR5eQpfOKN/kX7Uc5aZS5aupsjfwpGQEge2/3NYpy13R1gOtW2ZyAZCij1/8AKXVrl7uDX2M%2bNHb07xu0beZzEJNwLEp3AAeQUoKj6BVE9KgoZFfmrb5dwgzWR%2bJHSl1PM2slPbf1IxT58I70zeNJxloluPutjlWHFZUj2Azvy%2b2a%2b42fl1YOyrI9kbipUqUYASq/UEUTLPLZOcqbUBg9qsK8KGUn1rGtWGp49F0h6Yt9thNvGIwmZKUpbrgTkgA7DP0r4r1EbEc9EgkjA7VY8RbjdLJqRFpiQerDDoCHCD8qjkbnGcZxgeW1ZC%2bSrjP1A/b2pQjNRAOcNoypRxnl%2bneoVlb7Yer41idaaRi9XNtNqQlxtPUyAVqHv5Z7ZoufDBdXH5kiI6Om8lnLiFDdSc%2bFQ/Yj9qHcSwz5j0iPcem4HwXGwCTyEDJxzb428jW34USrhauJ9ltUdlJakRFuy0lKfBzJ5vCrzAHhOPzYpihpNCPKqlPt5njGcHlUrlByK6qsQSVCcAmpXDigEkZ3rjgWcV5Qg3a1ONx0uyJCglBI%2bXB339KAd9mToOq1Xcvw4zSSeZKF9RbvuCDsB96ZriTZo1ys6Zch6OyYR5yuQsIQU%2bqSo7CgZqaLGS8%2buS%2bEsoPN0tkpx7YFS%2bRFxm214z0PAtU6VFP1HzIuMh27Wufslh4boxgLBKAcdiF/ajpoHTcGPc5N9QerKeYbjoJAw2hOR4f1DGfoKUqXqh6ZfEBCXnGmxyRWmRk8yvb83kB7bUSrpxYn8ORp9iZyvy1uhyfAaWCluOEFIbB/yBIVn3HtROJU4v0X%2boX903F/6NQg713Q74UcUrNxGgurt6HYk5k5ciPEFQTnZQI2I%2b4oiA5FUCMVuoLzDsVlm3S4u9KHEaU86v2SB6e5PkB7mlc1T8Quo5ZWmyxolqYycKKes7j0yVeHP0Faz4t9SKi2K0aejvBKp7xfkoB36SPlz2Jz/wA0rsx8uJUE45lDbtR64LNYOUvcQSdF3zUHEPVK7hqa5y59rtIDyGHV/hKeJw34B4djlXl/bWxFptd5Lzd2Dj86OrC8OHxFRJwR6nc47UH9HarVppDLDa1iM%2b6tEptB%2bZOAEr7kH7ZHrRLNmuSdXyoqETGy%2byxyra2C/Eoq5lH0HN9gKS5dUpyz9FThWxri21pvtJ6FtVmkpnuRECUjJbSrfog%2bv6v4pUta3J28auu019RUXJLmOyQogD9gKP114r2mwall6ef6r0KKx0f6xKi4rrAHKTndQ8hzeYPaltWVS5TrpHLzrKz7DJzRaK%2buRQryLe8nJl1pDU1y0vcm51omPRH0HIU2f5B2IpmuHPxMQ5TrULWsdMRSsJTPYB6f%2b6PMfUZHalKcAT9K9CiScmmbcSz5F1/T/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"belongsTo":{"totalCount":0,"pageInfo":{"totalPages":1,"currentPage":1},"edges":[]}},"memberships":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"foundation","title":"foundation","path":"/team/memberships/foundation/"}},{"node":{"id":"tech","title":"tech","path":"/team/memberships/tech/"}}]}},"context":{}}

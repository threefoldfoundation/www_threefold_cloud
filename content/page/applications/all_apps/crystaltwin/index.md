## What is happening today?

The Internet started out as a dream technology, with the power to connect and empower us all. But now, our online world is full of fake news, identity thieves, bots, bugs, viruses and big â€œbosses." No matter which way we look at it, the world wide web has gotten out of control.

- We log on to countless different applications with countless different logins, but our data is scattered and owned by others.
- We seek information, but that information is not always verified.
- We store our digital lives, but it's not always secure.
- We share with our loved ones and our networks, but what we share is sometimes tracked and not owned by us.

Our digital lives have become complicated, inefficient, and insecure. The web that was supposed to connect us has started to ensnare us.

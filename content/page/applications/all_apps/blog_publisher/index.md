# Blog Publisher

![](./img/blogpublisherexample.png)

## How does it work?

For blog creation and management there are may options available in the market. From total end-to-end solutions like Squarespace, to doing-it-yourself and selecting the tools and software to run your blog. ThreeFold has created a tool that allows for deployment and blog management with version control, automatic update, and staging facilities.

## What do you need to do?

First, please note that in order to deploy a blog using this tool, you'll need some technical knowledge of Git.
<br/>
<br/>
The basic principle is that you create the content in the repository (html, markdown). Content creation can be done with any tools that you have experience with (or like). For example, you can use Github, but also ThreeFold's decentralized Gitea solution. The only requirement is that you store the content in a public or private repository. The actual deployment of the webserver infrastructure and all required domain setup for the blog to be publicly available is done in a one-click (and three questions) deployment.
<br/>

See: [ThreeFold Farming Blog](https://farming.threefold.io/blog) as an example.
